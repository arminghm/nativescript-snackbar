## Development Workflow

- Navigate to the `src` directory `cd src`
- Run `npm run build` to install deps and transpile source.
- Run `npm run demo.ios` for iOS or `npm run demo.android` for Android
- Make changes to plugin src directory or the demo app and HMR (webpack NS work flow) should sync changes.
